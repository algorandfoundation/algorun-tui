## Synopsis                                          
                                                                                                 
                                                                                                 
Catchup the node to the latest catchpoint.                                                       
                                                                                                 
Overview:                                                                                        
Starting a catchup will sync the node to the latest catchpoint.                                  
Actual sync times may vary depending on the number of accounts, number of blocks and the network.
                                                                                                 
Note: Not all networks support Fast-Catchup.
