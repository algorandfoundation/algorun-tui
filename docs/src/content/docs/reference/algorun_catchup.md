## Synopsis                                          
                                                                                                 
                                                                                                 
Fast-Catchup is a feature that allows your node to catch up to the network faster than normal.   
                                                                                                 
Overview:                                                                                        
The entire process should sync a node in minutes rather than hours or days.                      
Actual sync times may vary depending on the number of accounts, number of blocks and the network.
                                                                                                 
Note: Not all networks support Fast-Catchup.
