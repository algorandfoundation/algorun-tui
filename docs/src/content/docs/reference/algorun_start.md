Start the node daemon                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                               
Overview:                                                                                                                      
Start the Algorand daemon on your local machine if it is not already running. Optionally, the daemon can be forcefully started.
                                                                                                                               
This requires the daemon to be installed on your system.
