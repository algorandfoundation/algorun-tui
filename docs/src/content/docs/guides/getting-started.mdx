Welcome to NodeKit, your command-line one-stop-shop for Algorand node running.

NodeKit can help you with:

- Installing and configuring an Algorand node
- Syncing your node with the latest state of the network
- Managing consensus participation keys
- Monitoring your node and the network

To get started with NodeKit, copy-paste this command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="os">
<TabItem label="Linux">

```bash
wget -qO- https://nodekit.run/install.sh | bash
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS">

```sh
curl -fsSL https://nodekit.run/install.sh | bash
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

  <summary>Troubleshooting: Command 'bash' not found</summary>
  Some versions of Mac OS may not include the required `bash` executable that runs the installer.

  If you get an error about `bash` not being available, please install bash on your system manually.

  For Mac OS, a popular way to do this is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then install bash using:

  ```bash
  brew install bash
  ```
</details>

This will detect your operating system and download the appropriate NodeKit executable to your local directory.

It will then immediately start the bootstrap process to get your Algorand node up and running:
