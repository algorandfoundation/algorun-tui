## How to start the process

The bootstrap process is automatically started after following the [NodeKit installation instructions](/guides/getting-started), but it can also be triggered manually by running this command:

```bash
./nodekit bootstrap
```

## Prompts: Installation and Fast-catchup

`nodekit bootstrap` will check to see if there is a node already installed.

If there is none, it will ask if you want to start a node installation:

<Code showLineNumbers="no" wrap="no" code="Installing A Node

It looks like you're running this for the first time. Would you like to install a node? (y/n)" />

---

It will then ask if you want to perform a "fast-catchup" with the network:

<Code showLineNumbers="no" wrap="no" code="Regular sync with the network usually takes multiple days to weeks. You can optionally perform fast-catchup to sync in 30-60 minutes instead.

Would you like to preform a fast-catchup after installation? (y/n)" />

Fast-catchup saves a lot of time, so we recommend responding Yes.

---

Assuming you have responded "Yes" to the node install prompt, you will now be prompted for your user password:

```
WARN (You may be prompted for your password)
INFO Installing Algod on Linux
INFO Installing with apt-get
[sudo] password for user:
```

<details>
  <summary>Why is the installer asking for my password?</summary>
  The installer will ask for your user password during the node installation process.

  This is required by your operating system in order to install new software.
</details>

## Installation

After you enter your password, you can now sit back and wait until your Algorand node is installed and syncs with the network.

The installation phase should only take a few minutes. Your terminal will look like this during the installation phase:

## Fast catchup

After installation is complete, NodeKit will automatically start the NodeKit user interface.

This will display the progress of catching up to the latest state of the Algorand network:

This process usually takes between 30-60 minutes, depending on your hardware and network connection.

When the process is done, the Fast Catchup status information will disappear and the yellow `FAST-CATCHUP` status at the top will change to a green `RUNNING` state.

<details>
  <summary>Troubleshooting: Fast-catchup</summary>
  If the fast catchup process does not complete within 1-2 hours, check the following:

  **Your hardware meets the requirements**

  Check that your node meets the [hardware requirements](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/#hardware-requirements) for a participation node.

  **Nodekit is in FAST-CATCHUP state**

  The colored status at the top of Nodekit should be in a yellow `FAST-CATCHUP` state:

  ![](/assets/nodekit-state-fast-catchup.png)

  If not, exit nodekit with `Q` and run `./nodekit catchup` to start catching up. Then run `./nodekit` again to enter the user interface.

  After fast-catchup completes successfully, it is normal for a node to be in a `SYNCING` state for a few minutes:

  During this the `Latest Round` number should be increasing rapidly.

  If there is no progress for a while, or the Latest Round value is smaller than `46000000` (46 million) then you should start fast-catchup again.
