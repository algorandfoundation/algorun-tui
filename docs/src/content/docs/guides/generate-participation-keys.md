If it is not running already, start NodeKit with this command:

```bash
./nodekit
```

After your node has fully synced with the network, you will see a green `RUNNING` label at the top:

You will only be able to generate participation keys after your node is in a `RUNNING` state

## Generate participation keys

Press the `G` key to start generating participation keys.

NodeKit will ask the account address that will be participating in consensus. Enter your account address and press `ENTER`.

## Select participation key duration

NodeKit will ask the number of days that the participation keys will be valid for:

You can press the `S` key to cycle through duration modes in days / months / rounds.

The longer your duration, the longer the participation key generation step will take to complete.

We recommend a value between 30 and 90 days.

## Key generation

After you have selected your key duration, nodekit will instruct your node to generate participation keys.

The time required for this step will depend on your participation key duration. As an indicative wait time, a 30-day participation key should take between 4-6 minutes to generate.

  <summary>Troubleshooting: Failed to get participation keys</summary>
  Occasionally, Nodekit may fall out of sync with the Algorand node while waiting for the participation keys to be generated. In this case this error message will be shown:

  `failed to get participation keys`

  You can:

  - wait for the participation keys to appear in the Accounts list
  - try to generate a participation key again
    - If the key generation process is still running on the node, you will see a `Participation key generation already in progress` error

## Done

When your participation keys are ready, nodekit will display the key information as shown below.

You are now one step away from participating in Algorand consensus!

As the on screen message indicates, you can press `R` to start [Registering your keys](/guides/register-online).
