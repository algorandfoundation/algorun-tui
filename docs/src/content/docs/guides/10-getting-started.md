Welcome to Nodekit, your command-line one-stop-shop for Algorand node running.

To get started with Nodekit, copy-paste this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nodekit.run/install.sh | bash
```

This will detect your operating system and download the appropriate nodekit executable to your local directory.

It will then immediately start the bootstrap process to get your Algorand node up and running.

**Did you encounted any errors?** Check out the [Troubleshooting: Getting Started](/troubleshooting/10-getting-started) section.

Otherwise, read on for guidance on the bootstrapping process.
