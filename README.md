Terminal UI for managing Algorand nodes.
Built with [bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) & [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is in alpha state and under heavy development. We do not recommend performing actions (e.g. key management) on participation nodes.

# üöÄ Get Started

Run the build or ~~download the latest cli(WIP)~~.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not have pre-built binaries yet. If you are comfortable doing so, you are welcome to build it yourself and provide feedback.

## Building

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algorandfoundation/hack-tui.git
```

Change to the project directory

```bash
cd hack-tui
```

Run the build command

```bash
make build
```

Start a participation node

> [!NOTE]
> The docker image is used for development and testing purposes. TUI will also work with native algod.
> If you have a node installed already, you can skip this step.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Connect to the node

```bash
./bin/algorun --server http://localhost:8080 --token aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you skipped the docker container, try running `./bin/algorun` standalone, which will detect your algorand data directory from the `ALGORAND_DATA` environment variable that works for `goal`. Otherwise, provide the `--server` and `--token` arguments so that it can find your node.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is in alpha state and under heavy development. We do not recommend performing actions (e.g. key management) on participation nodes connected to public networks.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Usage

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is loaded in the following order:

1. Configuration file (.algorun.yaml)
   1. Current Directory
   2. Home Directory
   3. /etc/algorun/
2. ENV Configuration
   - ALGORUN\_\*
3. CLI Flag Arguments
4. ALGORAND_DATA parsing

This results in `ALGORAND_DATA` taking precedence in the loading order.
