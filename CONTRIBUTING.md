# 🫂 Contributing Guide

A guide on how to contribute to this project. Assumes you have git and go configured locally

# Building

Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:algorandfoundation/nodekit.git
```

Change to the directory

```bash
cd nodekit
```

Build the project

```bash
make build
```

Launch the TUI

```bash
./bin/nodekit
```

# 📂 Folder Structure

```bash
├── api        # Generated API Client and HTTPPkg methods
├── cmd        # Command Controller
├── internal   # Data Models/Fetch Wrappers/Tools/Utilities
└── ui         # BubbleTea Interfaces
```

There are three top level modules (**cmd**, **internal**, **ui**) which align with the GoLang/Charm ecosystem.
There is an additional code-generated file called **api/lf.go** which should not be edited by hand.
See [generating rpc package](#generating-rpc-package) for more information

All submodules and endpoints **SHOULD** align with the command/ui namespaces.

Example Command:

```bash
nodekit status
```

Example Structure

```bash
├── cmd/status.go
├── internal/status.go
└── ui/status/table.go
```

All submodules **SHOULD** abstract when appropriate to a submodule.

Example Refactor

```bash
├── cmd/status/root.go
├── internal/status/model.go
└── ui/status/table.go
```

Additional top level modules **SHOULD NOT** be relied on unless there is a clear reason.
A common abstraction found in other projects is a `server` module which handles any local daemons.

### 🧑‍💻 cmd

Folder for commands that can be run from the cli.
Effectively this package is the "controller" in MVC

- **SHOULD** be used to manage cli commands
- **SHOULD** mirror the name of the command.
  `cli-tool command-name` should be represented as
  `./cmd/command-name.go` or `./cmd/command-name/root.go`
- **SHOULD** bind the `internal` and `ui` models
- **SHOULD NOT** contain any model or UI code (only bindings).

### 🪨 internal

Common library code which includes the models and business logic
of the application.
Its main responsibility is constructing the state used in the TUI.
This package is considered the "Model" in MVC

- **SHOULD** be used to hold models.
- **SHOULD** mirror the namespace the models relate to.
- **SHOULD NOT** contain any UI or CLI specific code (example, IsVisible or any tea|cobra interfaces).

### 💄 ui

Elements to be presented to the user.
This is built on the `bubbletea` abstraction.
This package is the ViewModel and View in MVC.

- **SHOULD** be used to build bubbletea interfaces.
- **SHOULD** be named by the component it represents.
  For example, `./ui/table.go` for a reusable component or
  `./ui/command-name/table.go` for context specific elements
- **SHOULD** contain ViewModel state like "IsVisible"
- **SHOULD NOT** contain any model or CLI specific code (ViewModels/tea.Models should be composed of internal Models for testability).

# Generating RPC package

The `api` package is generated via [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen).
This is only required when adding new or missing RPC interfaces from the algod specification.
Its configuration is found under `generate.yaml` and can be run with the following make command:

```bash
make generate
```

The full command for reference

```bash
oapi-codegen -config generate.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorand/go-algorand/v3.26.0-stable/daemon/algod/api/algod.oas3.yml
```
